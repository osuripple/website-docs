- **I can't play on stable/beta/cutting edge**
- You need to install our HTTPS certificate. Download [our server switcher](https://mu.nyodev.xyz/upd.php?id=18) and click **"Install certificate"**. If you're still having problems, [follow these instructions](https://ripple.moe/index.php?p=16&id=12) to install the certificate **manually**.

-----------------------

- **My antivirus is blocking the switcher**
- That's because our switcher edits the hosts file. Turn off your antivirus and run the switcher again.

-----------------------

- **I get "Invalid Ripple IP" on the switcher, how do I fix it?**  
- Make sure you don't have invalid characters (such as spaces, commas and so on) in your Ripple IP. The IP must contain numbers and dots only.

-----------------------

- **I get "Connection failed" when I try to connect to Ripple**  
- Make sure the IP in the switcher is **46.105.123.39** not **127.0.0.1**. If the IP is set to 127.0.0.1, click the "Local/Remote" button, restart osu! and try to log in again. If you still can't solve this problem, come on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0rJcZruIsA6rXuIx) and we'll help you.

-----------------------

- **I get "Bancho authentication failed" (wrong password) when I try to log in, but my password is correct!**  
- Type your username and password, then press the **login** button with your mouse. I know, it's weird but it often works. *(make also sure that caps lock is disabled if your password is lowercase)*

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps from osu!direct.**
- Make sure you are using the latest version of the switcher. It should look like [this](https://b.catgirlsare.sexy/xqJw.png). If it looks different, download it again from [here](https://mu.nyodev.xyz/upd.php?id=18)

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps when I'm in multiplayer, but I can download them from the main menu**
- Disable **Automatically start osu!direct downloads** from the options and try again.

-----------------------

- **How do I play on the normal osu! again?**
- Close osu!, run the switcher and turn it off by clicking the **On/Off** button

-----------------------

- **My switcher is off but when I open osu.ppy.sh in my browser I get redirected to ripple's website!**
- Make sure the switcher is off, then empty your browser cache. [Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+empty+browser+cache) if you don't know how to do it.

-----------------------

- **I get strange errors on osu!'s website after playing on ripple (beatmaps not found etc)**
- Delete `s` and `t` cookies relative to osu.ppy.sh using a [cookie editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg). If you don't know how to remove specific cookies, just delete all cookies from your browser settings.

-----------------------

- **Can I keep playing while the server is restarting because it's updating?**
- Yes, your scores will be sent as soon as the server gets back online (usually less than a minute). Just make sure to not close the client.

-----------------------

- **Is there a patcher for ripple?**
- No, you can change server by editing the hosts file with our switcher. [Instructions here](https://ripple.moe/doc/1).

-----------------------

- **Can I have ripple's source code?**
-  Ripple is fully open source, you can see it [here](https://git.zxq.co/ripple/ripple).

-----------------------

- **Why are osu!direct and other in-game supporter perks free?**
- We think that osu! direct is very cool and it's a shame people have to pay to have it, that's why we're offering it for free on Ripple. If you like what we do, please consider a [donation](/donate)
