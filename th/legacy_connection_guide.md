- Enjoy  
_NOTE: If you can't install the certificate through the automatic procedure, follow [these instructions](https://ripple.moe/index.php?p=16&id=12) to install it manually._  

### How to play on official osu! again
- Make sure osu! is **closed**

- Make sure the switcher says **You are connected to osu!**  
- Open osu! and login with your osu! account  
_NOTE: If you want to connect to osu!'s website and you see ripple's website or an error, even if the switcher claims you're connected to osu!, empty your browser cache and restart your browser._
